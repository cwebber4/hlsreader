This is an exploratory script for parsing HLS transport stream packets. It is based on the specification found in ITU-T H.222.0 SERIES H: AUDIOVISUAL AND MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS (03/2017).

Not everything is implemented (e.g. program association table, conditional access table...). All basic fields of the TS packet should be detected and their respective values printed out in hex.
